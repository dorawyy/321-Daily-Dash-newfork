# Getting started with

`npm i` to install packages

## In development

`npm run dev` to run development server which follows typescript changes.
`npm run test` to run tests (once we have them).

## In production

`npm run build && npm run start` to deploy.

If you use `screen npm run start`, the server will keep running after ssh session is closed.
